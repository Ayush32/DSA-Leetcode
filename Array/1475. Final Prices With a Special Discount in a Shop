Given the array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop. 
There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] 
where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i], otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> finalPrices(vector<int>& prices) {
        vector<int>discount;
        
        for(int i = 0;i<prices.size()-1;i++){
            for(int j = i + 1;j<prices.size();j++)
            {
                if(prices[i]>= prices[j]){
                    prices[i] -= prices[j];
                    break;
                }
                
            }
        }
        return prices;
    }
};
