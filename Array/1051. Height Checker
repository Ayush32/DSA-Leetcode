You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the 
students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3

class Solution {
public:
    int heightChecker(vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<int>expected = heights;
        sort(expected.begin(),expected.end());
        int count  = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i<heights.size();i++)
        {
            if(heights[i] != expected[i])
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
