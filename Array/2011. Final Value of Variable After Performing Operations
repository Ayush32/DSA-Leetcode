Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1

class Solution {
public:
    int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
        int X = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ;i<operations.size();i++)
        {
            if(operations[i] == "--X" or operations[i] == "X--")
            {
                X = X - 1; 
            }
            
            if(operations[i] == "++X" or operations[i] == "X++")
            {
                X = X + 1; 
            }
        }
        return X;
    }
};
